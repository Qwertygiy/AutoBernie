# AutoBernie Terms of Service
###Revised 9/21/24

A core feature of the AutoBernie Discord bot is its various searchable databases of racing-related information and media, such as photographs of racing events and videos of event replays. While AutoBernie moderators make good-faith efforts to keep this information accurate and consistent, the content of these databases is entirely supplied by users, and the AutoBernie team makes no guarantee that all information provided will be relevant or accurate.

Content may be added to these databases using commands such as '/addpic' within the AutoBernie Official Discord Server. All textual metadata provided to the AutoBernie database is treated as being released to the public domain under the [Creative Commons CC0 license](https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/cc0/) ([full text](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode)), and may be modified, copied, or deleted by other users without restriction. This release does not affect any images, video, audio, or any other content that may be connected to said metadata via hyperlink; all linked media content is made available through fair use, and remains the intellectual property of its copyright holder(s).

All users are expected to conform to reasonable standards of use when contributing to the databases, and abuse or vandalism may result in a loss of bot privileges for the user responsible, including but not limited to the inability to add content through commands such as '/addpic', a ban from the AutoBernie Official Discord Server, or the inability to use any AutoBernie commands across Discord.

The following actions are examples of what will be considered abuse:
- Contribution of poor-quality material to a database. All entries are expected to be useful results; while images do not need to be professional photos available in 4K resolution, they are expected to display the referent of their metadata in a clear and recognizable fashion. Only vehicles that are at least halfway visible and large enough to be clearly identifiable should be catalogued within a photo. Advertisements, reviews, memes, broadcast footage with graphic overlays, intrusive watermarks, and other processed media is only accepted if the edited content is unobtrusive, unavoidable, and no unprocessed alternative of comparable quality is available.
- Contribution of off-topic material to a database. All images or video should be related to the subject of the database in some way, and should have minimal modification or editing from the original photograph or broadcast. While humorous entries are not forbidden, they should remain related to the subject of the database and should not interfere with serious search results, and are subject to removal at any time.
- Contribution of forbidden material to a database. Images of crashes that resulted in a fatality are forbidden (e.g. the 2001 Daytona 500), as are images of crashes that resulted in a career-ending injury (e.g. Jerry Nadeau), or that have a graphic focus on a driver's injury (e.g. being loaded onto a stretcher). Renders, artwork, and promotional material should not be added to photo databases.
- Contribution of vandalism, spam, or otherwise objectionable material to a database entry. Intentionally adding inaccurate and misleading metadata may constitute vandalism, as well as metadata that is so incomplete or malformed as to be generally useless. Defacing or erasing existing content is an especially serious offense.
- Violation of [Discord Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms), such as hate speech, harassment, or violations of privacy. This should go without saying, but we're saying it anyway. Be helpful, not hurtful.
