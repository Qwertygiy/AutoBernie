# AutoBernie Privacy Policy
###Revised 9/21/24

When using commands such as '/addpic' to contribute data to one of the AutoBernie databases, all textual information that you explicitly provide through the command will be stored within the AutoBernie database indefinitely. This is, after all, the primary purpose of said database. This information will be logged and visible to AutoBernie moderators on Discord, even if the information is later replaced or deleted within the database, and will be associated with your Discord user ID.

AutoBernie does not store, sell, or knowingly make any user information, identifiable or otherwise, available for any commercial purposes, nor publicly available for any purposes, with the exception of textual metadata provided through the use of database commands such as '/addpic' within the AutoBernie Official Discord Server. This metadata may be modified by any user, or deleted by trusted members and moderators.

To request the deletion of previously logged information, please contact @qwertyghosty on Discord.
